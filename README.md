Add a voting system to social media platforms that cannot be influenced by Big Tech

## How does it work?

This browser extension integrates with existing social media platforms (e.g. X.com) in order to overlay an external voting system outside of the platform's control.

The votes are cast by burning [Lotus cryptocurrency](https://lotusia.org/faq). The extension has a built-in wallet that holds your Lotus. When you cast a vote on the social media platform, the extension will automatically burn the Lotus from your wallet in order to cast your vote with the positive sentiment (upvote) or negative sentiment (downvote).

Posts that have accummulated a negative reputation (i.e. more downvotes than upvotes) will automatically be blurred from immediate view. These posts can still be viewed if the user desires. For example, on X.com, a button is displayed over the blurred post that will navigate you to the post's page to see the full context of the post and all replies.
